# Testnets

Lighthouse does not offer a public testnet _yet_. In the meantime, it's easy to
start a local testnet:

- [Run a simple testnet](testnets.html) in Only Three CLI Commandsâ„¢.
- Developers of other Eth2 clients should see the [interop guide](interop.html).
- The [sigp/lighthouse-docker](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse-docker) repo
	contains a `docker-compose` setup that runs a multi-node network with
	built-in metrics and monitoring dashboards, all from your local machine.
