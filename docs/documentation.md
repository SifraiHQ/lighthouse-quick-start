# Lighthouse Technical Documentation

The technical documentation, as generated by Rust, is available at [lighthouse-docs.sigmaprime.io](http://lighthouse-docs.sigmaprime.io/).

This documentation is generated from Lighthouse and updated regularly.


### How to update:

- `cargo doc`: builds the docs inside the `target/doc/` directory.
- `aws s3 sync target/doc/ s3://lighthouse-docs.sigmaprime.io/`: Uploads all of the docs, as generated with `cargo doc`, to the S3 bucket.

**Note**: You will need appropriate credentials to make the upload.
