//! The `ImportManager` facilities the block syncing logic of lighthouse. The current networking
//! specification provides two methods from which to obtain blocks from peers. The `BeaconBlocks`
//! request and the `RecentBeaconBlocks` request. The former is used to obtain a large number of
//! blocks and the latter allows for searching for blocks given a block-hash.
//!
//! These two RPC methods are designed for two type of syncing.
//! - Long range (batch) sync, when a client is out of date and needs to the latest head.
//! - Parent lookup - when a peer provides us a block whose parent is unknown to us.
//!
//! Both of these syncing strategies are built into the `ImportManager`.
//!
//!
//! Currently the long-range (batch) syncing method functions by opportunistically downloading
//! batches blocks from all peers who know about a chain that we do not. When a new peer connects
//! which has a later head that is greater than `SLOT_IMPORT_TOLERANCE` from our current head slot,
//! the manager's state becomes `Syncing` and begins a batch syncing process with this peer. If
//! further peers connect, this process is run in parallel with those peers, until our head is
//! within `SLOT_IMPORT_TOLERANCE` of all connected peers.
//!
//! Batch Syncing
//!
//! This syncing process start by requesting `MAX_BLOCKS_PER_REQUEST` blocks from a peer with an
//! unknown chain (with a greater slot height) starting from our current head slot. If the earliest
//! block returned is known to us, then the group of blocks returned form part of a known chain,
//! and we process this batch of blocks, before requesting more batches forward and processing
//! those in turn until we reach the peer's chain's head. If the first batch doesn't contain a
//! block we know of, we must iteratively request blocks backwards (until our latest finalized head
//! slot) until we find a common ancestor before we can start processing the blocks. If no common
//! ancestor is found, the peer has a chain which is not part of our finalized head slot and we
//! drop the peer and the downloaded blocks.
//! Once we are fully synced with all known peers, the state of the manager becomes `Regular` which
//! then allows for parent lookups of propagated blocks.
//!
//! A schematic version of this logic with two chain variations looks like the following.
//!
//! |----------------------|---------------------------------|
//! ^finalized head        ^current local head               ^remotes head
//!
//!
//! An example of the remotes chain diverging before our current head.
//! |---------------------------|
//!          ^---------------------------------------------|
//!          ^chain diverges    |initial batch|            ^remotes head
//!
//! In this example, we cannot process the initial batch as it is not on a known chain. We must
//! then backwards sync until we reach a common chain to begin forwarding batch syncing.
//!
//!
//! Parent Lookup
//!
//! When a block with an unknown parent is received and we are in `Regular` sync mode, the block is
//! queued for lookup. A round-robin approach is used to request the parent from the known list of
//! fully sync'd peers. If `PARENT_FAIL_TOLERANCE` attempts at requesting the block fails, we
//! drop the propagated block and downvote the peer that sent it to us.
